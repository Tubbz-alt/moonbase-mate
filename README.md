Installation
------------

If you want to get MATE desktop support on your Lunar Linux installation simply clone this repo to your zlocal path in /usr/lib/lunar/moonbase/zlocal

Status
------

This MATE repository is still under development and should not be included to any stable Lunar Linux installation, except for testing!

Dependencies
------------

Some libraries and tools depend on gtk+-3 and libnotify4, which are both only available in the gnome3 repository for Lunar Linux. So if you want to try this repo out be sure to have the gnome3 repo included as well.
